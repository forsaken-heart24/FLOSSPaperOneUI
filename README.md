**Customize Your Samsung OneUI ROM'S Wallpapers**

‚≠êÔ∏è An open-source tool to help you personalize your modified samsung stock ROM'S wallpapers using an 
bash script to make a json file that is used in the samsung's wallpaper-res application
for the wallpaper(s) and it's informations.

‚ù£ i hope it would be an useful tool for you, thank me later if it is!

# üîÜ How to use this bash script?
```
git clone https://github.com/forsaken-heart24/FLOSSPaperOneUI/; cd FLOSSPaperOneUI; chmod +x FLOSSPaper.sh && ./FLOSSPaper.sh
```

# ‚≠ï What to do after executing the script?
* The shell script will tell you where did the resources_info.json file is located after the job is being done.

* If you have the file on that folder, copy and disassemble the "wallpaper-res.apk" application, which is located in the "system/priv-app/wallpaper-res" folder, from your legally purchased Samsung device(s).

* After disassembling, copy the "resources_info.json" file into the decompiled application's data folder, named "res/raw". Add the wallpaper images into the "res/drawable-nodpi" folder with their appropriate names.

* Recompile the application, sign the new APK, and place it in the "system/priv-app/wallpaper-res/" folder. Finally, reboot your device. You're now set up with custom wallpapers in the system.
